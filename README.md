Linux-Raspbian

## My experience of having used Linux distro.: Raspbian...    

I recall buying a Raspberry Pi SBC/Small Board Computer...;   
on which there was installed a Linux distribution flavour called: Raspbian;    
It was fun...especially, because the particular version of Linux came with a built-in GUI/Graphical User Interface.  

This is also where I first learned how to SSH/Secure SHell...using Windows Putty software...remotely into a Linux machine;  
though operating Linux through the CLI/Command Line Interface...wasn't nearly as much fun as using a GUI...for people who are relatively *inexperienced*.
