Linux-Raspbian

## My experience of having used Linux distro.: Raspbian...    

I recall buying a Raspberry Pi SBC/Small Board Computer...;   
on which there was installed a Linux distribution flavour called: Raspbian;    
It was fun...especially, because this particular version of Linux came with a built-in GUI/Graphical User Interface.  

## SSH/Secure SHell (operate a computer remotely)  

Using the Raspberry Pi, was also where I first learned how to SSH/Secure SHell    
-by using Windows Putty software- remotely into a Linux machine;  
though, operating Linux through the CLI/Command Line Interface...wasn't nearly as much fun as using a GUI...;    
especially, for those people who are relatively *inexperienced* at knowing exactly which commands to use inside of the CLI...?
